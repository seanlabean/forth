<h2>Blorth </h2>
<p>Blorth is a custom Forth-based interpreter which enables the embedding of Forth commands within a text document, outputting HTML formatted files.
</p>
<p>"Data is code." A powerful mantra in an era when data are considered only insofar as their ability to be consumed. Indeed, large language models have taken the exact opposite position: "Code is data". Forth enables orthogonal perspectives in other ways too, the stack-based nature of the language requires the programmer to be hyper-aware of the state of the processes they write. Efficiency and care become unspoken yet obvious requirements of Forth programs. Programmers exposed only to modern languages may never consider the implications of creating, populating, and modifying a dataframe Megabytes in size. Of course, this is isn't a blunder or a misgiving on their part, such nonchalant behavior is encouraged by every language of the 21st century. It makes life easier, and the resources available to even beginners have redefined "efficiency" and "considerate programming" so many times and to such extreme degress that they have become antonyms of their original selves from the mid 1900s.

<p>A sample .bth file might look something like this:</p><blockquote><pre>^html
^h2 A beautiful heading ^h2
^p A paragraph about Forth ^+p
Another paragraph about Forth ^/p
^href https://slewis.wiki link to my blog ^/href
^/html
</pre></blockquote> <p>Where the <code>^</code> sign informs the Forth program to break out of the continuous character dump to the outfile buffer to execute the Forth word that follow. For example, the program will interpret <code>^href</code> as the <i>word</i> <code>href</code> which itself is defined as outputing the string <code>"&lt;a href=" </code> as well as the following token, <code>https://slewis.wiki</code> in the example above, then closing the <code>a</code> element with <code>">"</code> . The following text "link to my blog" is then read into the output buffer and the <code>a</code> element is closed with <code>^/href</code> . </p>
<p>
A curious self-referencial loop is taking place here, in that I am describing the program that parsed and wrote this text I am writing into the text you are reading which itself can be parsed by the same program. I don't really know what to make of that but it tickles me. To take it to the extreme, the following is the code necessary to process the .bth sample and is the same code that constructs this page. About 60 lines of Forth. </p>
